## Description
- This is a project that will creat a team profile card page based on user information that is put in through the command line when you run the app
- This was built to further deepen my skills using inquirer, jest and OOP programming.
- I did have a few challenges with being able to connect multiple files to 1 file, but I found that as I was able to learn more about importing and exporting the project had become easier to accomplish and helped me how to better organize my code using multiple files.
